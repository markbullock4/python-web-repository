Python Web Registration App Repository

This Application is a simple Python based web application which contains:
  -Registration, Login and View screens.
  
The application could be improved but it was made quite quickly so i could demo some new infrastructure.

Could do with some security configured, some key management and then hand-in-hand some HTTPS/SSL web server.
Also some cosmetic improvements could be easily made to enhance the look and feel of the application.

Pre-Requisities:
-A Postgres database needs to be created and tables created in advance - check out the app.py code 
 to identify the correct table name and fields required.
-The following needs changing in the main app.py to point at your own database
    DB_URL = "..."

ENJOY!
